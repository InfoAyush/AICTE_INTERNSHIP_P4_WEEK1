# AICTE_INTERNSHIP_P4_WEEK1
EV Adoption Prediction â€“ Week 1 Progress
This repository contains the Week 1 work for the Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Prediction project. The goal of this phase was to perform initial data exploration, clean the dataset, and handle issues that may affect model performance in later stages.

ðŸ”§ Improvisations & Enhancements

Missing Value Handling

Visualized missing data using a heatmap for clarity.

Dropped rows with missing County or State values to avoid introducing artificial or misleading categories.

Outlier Detection & Treatment

Used boxplots and histograms to identify skewed distributions and extreme outliers in Percent Electric Vehicles.

Applied Winsorization to cap extreme values instead of removing them, preserving important insights from high-adoption regions.

Preprocessing for Modeling

Conducted early data cleaning to ensure the dataset is well-prepared for robust, interpretable machine learning models in the upcoming phases.
